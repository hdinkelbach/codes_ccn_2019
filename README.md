# rate-coded

This folder contains the implementation of the lin_rate_ipn model. The NEST implementation was based on the documentation of NEST. 

# COBA

This is a repeated benchmark of Vitay et al. 2015 with newer versions of the simulators and extended by Brian2GeNN. We provide the connectivity matrices.
